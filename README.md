Automated License Plate Recognition (ANPR) System for Parking Management
Project Overview
This project is an Automated License Plate Recognition (ANPR) System designed to enhance parking management and vehicle monitoring using deep learning, OpenCV, Flask, and MySQL. The system detects, recognizes, and stores license plate numbers from live video streams or recorded footage, making it a powerful solution for automated access control, security enforcement, and vehicle tracking in parking lots, gated communities, and restricted areas.

Importance & Applications
🚗 Efficient Parking Management

Automatically identifies and verifies vehicles entering and exiting parking areas.

Reduces the need for manual ticketing, ensuring a faster and more secure parking experience.

🛡️ Enhanced Security & Access Control

Prevents unauthorized vehicles from entering restricted areas.

Supports whitelist/blacklist functionality to block or allow specific vehicles.

📊 Scalable Database Management (MySQL)

The system stores and manages large volumes of license plate data in a structured and scalable MySQL database.

Enables real-time queries, updates, and deletions of plate numbers for seamless control.

🎥 Live Streaming & Real-Time Detection

Integrates with IP cameras & RTSP streams for continuous, real-time vehicle monitoring.

Uses deep learning to detect and extract plate numbers from frames accurately.

🏙️ Wide-Scale Usage in Urban Mobility

Can be deployed in public and private parking lots, toll booths, residential communities, airports, and government facilities.

Reduces congestion by automating vehicle entry & exit processes.
